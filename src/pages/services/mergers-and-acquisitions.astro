        <p>We actively work with owners who are considering a transaction that hands a larger ownership position to the next generation or current management team. We have a track record of working cooperatively with owners as they navigate the right exit and structure that meets their valuation and transaction objectives. <strong>Redrock</strong> routinely works through a full consideration of this alternative in conjunction with the exploration of other liquidity options for their ownership.</p>
