Redrock Strategic Advisors supports creative transactions that require unique private capital solutions, including debt refinances, capital and advice for ESOP transactions, and majority recapitalizations.

- **Debt Capital Advisory.** We confidentially work with companies in unique situations that require a broader process to identify new debt capital partners. We identify a variety of private credit and debt capital partners and options to support a management or shareholder team's objectives.
- **Non-Dilutive Growth Capital.** We advise businesses that can take advantage of balance sheet strategies to drive debt-driven or structured capital solutions to support growth.
- **ESOP Funding & Completion.** Employee Stock Ownership Plans (ESOPs) can be an excellent liquidity solution for ownership groups that are looking for a long-term ownership transition strategy to employees. ESOPs require specialized advice and capital solutions to fund the transaction. 
- **Majority Recapitalization.** Redrock advises majority equity holders in a search for a new owner or investor group to take their position in private companies through a majority recapitalization transaction.
