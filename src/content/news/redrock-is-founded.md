SOUTH JORDAN, UT (February 16, 2026) -- Redrock Strategic Advisors officially launches to provide middle market founders and family-owned businesses with access to the dedicated deal teams and professional infrastructure often focused on large corporations. 

Redrock was built on a straightforward principle: successful business owners deserve true advisory partnerships, not just transactional relationships. The firm commits real resources to client success, ensuring founders have seasoned professionals alongside them at every critical juncture.

"We've seen too many founders navigate critical decisions—sales, recapitalizations, strategic pivots—without the professional support they need," said Geoffrey Loos, Managing Director at Redrock. "Our firm exists to change that by building genuine partnerships and dedicating meaningful time and attention to each client engagement."

Unlike firms that spread resources thinly across numerous deals, Redrock deliberately works with a select group of clients to ensure deeper impact. This focused approach allows the firm to deploy proprietary analytical tools, evolving technology solutions, and experienced professionals who have guided successful outcomes throughout transactions and critical business milestones.

Redrock serves U.S. middle market companies with strong revenue growth and proven track records, advising on transactions, recapitalizations, and strategic corporate decisions where expertise matters most.

Redrock is continuously building the next generation of deal professionals, recruiting hardworking, financially-minded individuals and training them from day one to become seasoned advisors and partners at Redrock. The firm seeks professionals who can deliver meaningful value to clients, to Redrock, and to their own personal and professional development.

"Our model works because we grow alongside our clients," Loos added. "By working with a select number of clients and investing heavily in each relationship, we can deliver the results middle market businesses deserve."
